# Unity Weapon Experiments

This is a project where I experiment with different weapon mechanics, starting at the most basic level and expanding out to more complex things.
## TODO

- Optimize how the weapon effects are instantiated.
- Deterministic non-physics based bullet drop (Curved Ray-casting)
  - Bullet Travel
- Aim Down Sight
- Designer-friendly reload configurations
- Custom Inspector windows
- Tooling to set up a weapon rig

## Completed Features
- Shooting
- Reloading
- Semi-Automatic and Automatic fire
- Recoil
- Weapon Sway

## Interesting Derivatives
- Have ray-casts return hit damageable components
